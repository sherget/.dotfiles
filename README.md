# Xmonad windowmanager and basic tool
We have to install xmonad manually because the ubuntu repos are outdated as usual.
Current xmonad version 0.17 is already 3 years old or older. No update in the repositories.
```bash
mkdir ~/config/.xmonad
https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install xmobar dmenu feh trayer
```

# Compton composite manager for transparencies
```bash
sudo apt install compton 
```

# Terminalemulator
```bash
```
